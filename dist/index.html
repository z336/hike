          <p>Recently, I completed the &quot;Trans-Zion Trek&quot; through the backcountry of Zion National Park. The
            trek is a
            multi-day hike that connects several of Zion's backcountry trails into one path that makes its way from one
            corner of the park to the other. As a fan of hiking, national parks, and the outdoors, it was the obvious
            choice for seeing the best of Zion in a short amount of time.</p>

          <p>The trek began early in the morning in St. George, UT, a small mountain town located in the northeastern
            corner of the Mojave Desert and near the park. I ate a hearty breakfast of eggs, a stack of pancakes, and a
            few cups of black coffee at a nearby diner. From there I drove to Zion National Park, where I parked the
            rental car and double checked my gear one last time.</p>

          <p>After a prearranged shuttle service ferried me to the first trailhead, l set off for the first day of the
            hike. I found myself immediately impressed with the most beautiful landscape I had ever seen in person. The
            grass was a lush green, the soil was red, and cliffs and canyons were visible in every direction. This
            first day was the shortest leg of the journey, so when I reached the first campsite in the afternoon I set
            up my tent and immediately took off for more exploring. The grassy surroundings quickly gave way to dusty,
            dry hills covered with evergreen trees that smelled so very fresh. After wandering for a few hours, I went
            back to the campsite to cook dinner before it got dark.</p>

          <p>The following morning I woke up with the sun, brewed some coffee and had breakfast. The second day was
            going to be the longest part of the hike, so I wanted to get moving as soon as I could. I hiked about 20
            miles that day and saw wildly different landscapes that seemed to appear out of nowhere. After the forest
            of evergreen trees I briefly explored the previous day, the trail elevated quite a bit to a forested
            plateau. It began to snow lightly at this elevation and I saw several wild turkeys. After descending from
            the plateau, I walked through another valley filled with evergreen trees and streams. It was as warm as
            summer. I hiked and hiked and finally set up camp for the night after retrieving some water from a slow but
            steady spring in Wildcat Canyon. According to my plans, the following day was going to include a shorter
            hike with less challenging terrain.</p>

          <p>On the third day I walked across amazing ridges that overlooked canyons and valleys. It was warm, but not
            hot, and it felt like I was beginning to really find my stride on this hike. Then a hail storm blew up
            while I was following the West Rim trail, one of the most photographed sections of the Zion backcountry,
            and it threatened to cause some serious problems. I had rain gear and warm clothing for this trip, but I
            did not expect to encounter such a long winter storm. The wind, rain, and hail blasted me for hours. By the
            time I reached the final camp I was thoroughly soaked and very, very cold. I methodically set up my tent,
            removed my soaked attire to lay it out under a tree, and changed into my dry sleeping clothes. Next, I
            boiled some water and drank it once it became tolerable to raise my core temperature. I quickly drifted off
            for a nice nap after getting under my quilt. I remember that it began to rain once again as I fell asleep,
            but I had luckily secured camp by this point. Later that night, several deer decided to walk up and hang
            out while I cooked dinner.</p>

          <p>The next morning arrived and it was still raining and foggy. Regardless, the park looked amazing to me and
            I was eager to take off for the final leg of the journey. I put on my still reasonably wet hiking clothes
            with a grimace and took off. I can still vividly remember encountering other people for the first time
            after being off the grid for a while. I had never grasped how strong soap, deodorant, detergent, and all
            the other modern conveniences smelled like I did on that day. I wouldn’t say I felt negatively about it,
            but the sensation was certainly overwhelming. I had never spent so much time away from people and
            civilization before.</p>

          <p>After a bus ride I finally returned to my rental car. I couldn’t deny that it felt good to sit in a car
            seat once again. My drive took me to the nearest Del Taco where I feasted like a king on the best fast food
            trash of my life. Hours later I was on a plane in Las Vegas, homeward bound and grinning.</p>
